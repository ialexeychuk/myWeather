* Hi, this is my test project where i learned how to fetch data from internet and work with CoreLocation.

* I used:
    - MVC architecture
    - UIKit 
    - StoryBoard
    - Autolayout
    - CoreLocation
    - Multithreading
    - URLSession
    - OpenWeatherMap API

* This app fetch data about the weather based on your current location when you run it (if you allow to use your location). 
* You will recive current weather, how it feels like and the image to show if it is raining, cloudy, or the sky is clear 
* You can check the weather in any other city by touching the "search" button in the lower right corner.
* And you can also update the data by touching the "refresh" button in the lower left corner.  
* As well it has adaptive interface so you can run it and rotate on any iPhone without missing UI elements
